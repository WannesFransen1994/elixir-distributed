# Elixir distributed

## Goal

In this course we'll cover the distributed aspects of Elixir. We assume that you've completed the [elixir-basics](https://github.com/WannesFransen1994/elixir-basics) course and [elixir-otp](https://github.com/WannesFransen1994/elixir-otp) course. The topics are listed under [Topics](#topics), which will be a short summary of what is covered in this repository.

## Topics

- [X] Connecting nodes (manually & with libcluster)
- [X] Internode communication (through GenServer API)
- [X] global registry
- [X] distributed app that naively balances games over different nodes

## Roadmap / missing topics

- [ ] Kafka
- [ ] Kubernetes
- [ ] Node takeover / failover?
- [ ] Horde?
- [ ] Riak?
- [ ] Redis?

## Credit

Thanks to [Frederic Vogels](https://github.com/fvogels) for checking, creating and contributing to these exercises. Due to restructuring, the commits are no longer in the commit log, but will not be forgotten.

These exercises were originally created for the course Distributed Applications at [UCLL](https://www.ucll.be/). Most of this content is thus sponsored by UCLL.

Extra thanks to every contributor, student and the Elixir community.
